 * Class: Maze
 * -----------
 * This class is used to represent a maze and provide operations to
 * query and change the maze configuration. A maze is a rectangular grid
 * of cells. Each cell identified by pointT (row-col struct).
 * Coordinates in the maze are numbered starting at (0,0) in
 * the lower left corner.
 * A location has neighbors in the four major compass directions (some
 * neighbors may not exist for cells along the outer border).  The
 * maze tracks which walls are up between a cell and its neighbor.

 * Type: pointT
 * ------------
 * The type pointT is used to encapsulate a pair of integer
 * coordinates into a single value with row and col components.
